## Overview
This shows how to setup and use PayForm from a basic app.

## PayForm

PayForm is a small client-side Android library that handles customer credit card input within the merchant's app. Most apps will let users launch PayForm from something like a button action.

This Android library limits the scope of a merchant's PCI compliance by removing the need for them to pass the sensitive information (credit card number, CVD, or expiry) through their servers and from having to write and store code that comes in contact with that sensitive information.
